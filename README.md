# Birthday Simulator

This Python program simulates the birthdays of a specified number of people and calculates the probability that at least two individuals share the same birthday. 
The program generates random birthdays while considering the variations in the number of days in different months, including a weighted approach for February to account for leap years.

## Features

- **Random Birthday Generation**: Assigns random birthdays to each person, ensuring correct day limits based on the month.
- **Probability Calculation**: Computes the probability that at least two people in a room share the same birthday using the Birthday Paradox formula.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Checks for any shared birthdays and lists the individuals who share the same date.
